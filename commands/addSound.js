    	/*
		Process map:
		+ User requests sound addition (Outside this environment)
		+ Bot checks for user sound quota (10 per person?)
			- How are we going to handle this??? Skip for now, but is needed
		+ 		- Code in a hard limit of 50 per sever for now, abuse mitigation (That I don't think is needed)
		+ Bot replies with prompt for desired name
		+ User selects name
		- If invalid, request new name
		+ Otherwise, request file
			- 1st implementation: Directly send file (will limit potential size problems) 
			- Eventually add support for direct links and/or youtube?
		- Prompt for active server
		-	Find servers user & SB are in
		-	Give numeric options (1, 2, 3, etc)
		-	Select option -> get server ID -> Place in there
		+ Download file to appropriate folder

		NOTE: 
			Restricting file to specific servers could lead to size issues.
				Opt 1: 
					o Remove server limitations
					+ All available in one place, nice and easy
					+ No dupliation going on
					- All sounds available for everyone
					- No restrictions
				Opt 2:
					o Cross-server aliasing
					+ Could remove some serverside duplication
					- User-based
					- Difficult implementation
					- Minor gains
				Opt 3:
					o Hardlink crawler
					+ As much gains as possible
					+ Automated
					- High processing
					- Minor differences would lead to duplication
