# soundBot
An easy-to-use bot for Discord. Play custom sounds when you want!


## Installation

Eventually I hope to make this self-hosted, so anyone can use it, but unfortunately if you're reading this that hasn't happened yet.

Instead, you can install in a few simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to wherever you want to run it from
2. From the folder, ensure npm is installed. Then, run `npm install`
3. Once all packages have been installed, create a file named `secret.json` in the folder. Format it as follows:


```
{

        "token": "TOKEN"
        
}
```

   Insert the token you'll be using for your bot in place of TOKEN. If you need help, [here's a handy guide](https://discordjs.guide/#/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application), courtesy of discord.js

4. Run using `node .`





This bot was created with the goal of doing one thing very well. If you encounter any issues please report them or submit a pull request, and hopefully it'll get taken care of quickly.

## Using

You can access all available commands using $list. Soundbot should then walk you through the various options you have.
